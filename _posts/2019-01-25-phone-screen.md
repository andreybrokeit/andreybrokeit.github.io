Why do we conduct screening interviews over the phone?
Because we are mean and want other people on the other end of the line to suffer?
Or we have nothing else to do but listen to the awkward, semi-stuttering speech with a phone static that makes this whole experience sound like a really bad DJ remix of LoFi Jazz/HipHop stream on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lofi+hip+hop).

When your poorly screened candidates come into the office and spend 6 hours each talking to your coworkers - it becomes very expensive to do so week after week. Not as expensive as <a href="#" alt="placeholder another post">poorly executed meetings</a>, but still not cheap. The time we invest into proper screening will pay off greatly very soon.

You should always improve your hiring process. All the time.
Every interview, every call, and every job post should be evaluated.

If you have a long streak of sub-optimal candidates that sounded really on the phone - the problem most likely "it's not you it's me". You screening process has to be adjusted. You should modify script and questions you ask. Analyze all failed candidates and see what was their shortcomings. Then add questions to the phone screen that will test those areas.
Always improve efficiency of the screening, otherwise you just gamble, hoping to roll a critical hit and get your next hire. Well, that's <a href="https://www.random.org/" alt="RNGesus">RNG</a> - not a hiring process.

From my countless phone calls I can say that quality of connection will 100% affect your perception of the candidate. So make sure to be prepared. Check your past century phone moster in the conference room ahead of time. Make sure your cellphone does not have 7% charge left because you were watching <a href="https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver" alt="HBO: Last Week Tonight">John Oliver</a> on the way to work.

I usually like to ask open ended questions - during phone screens and during interviews. It allows candidates to show what technology they were exposed to, talk about things they are comfortable with or, most importantly, passionate about.
One of the easiest questions is to talk about past jobs and career development. This is a 2 minute "elevator ride" speech that they can present themselves in the form and shape they want to appear to me. It also supposed to be one of the questions they HAD to prepare so it should relax them a little during the monologue and let them get into the interviewing beat.

After that you should dig in more into their experience and actual impactful projects they did. Just like Elon Musk <a href="https://www.inc.com/kevin-j-ryan/how-to-hire-like-elon-musk.html">said</a> in his interview: "If someone was really the person who solved it, they'll be able to answer on multiple levels."

Everyone have some generic things on their resumes: designed, developed, implemented, improved, adopted, integrated and so on. Pick one and try to figure out if they really did anything with it or it's just a filler. You do not want to eat a fluff, a proverbial coding popcorn. You want a real meat, get into action and see if they are comfortbale discussing it - because that's exactly what they will do with you coworkers in day to day life if you hire them.

The rest of the screen depends on the seniority: you may ask some basic questions and see if they know anything at all. Or you can dive deep into design questions: how would you implement some feature or design a system or just design for a specific failure.
