Why do we conduct screening interviews over the phone?
Because we are mean and want other people on the other end of the line to suffer?
Or we have nothing else to do but listen to the awkward, semi-stuttering speech with a phone static that makes this whole experience sound like a really bad DJ remix of LoFi Jazz/HipHop stream on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lofi+hip+hop).

When your poorly screened candidates come into the office and spend 6 hours each talking to your coworkers - it becomes very expensive to do so week after week. Not as expensive as <a href="#" alt="placeholder another post">poorly executed meetings</a>, but still not cheap. The time we invest into proper screening will pay off greatly very soon.

You should always improve your hiring process. All the time.
Every interview, every call, and every job post should be evaluated.

If you have a long streak of sub-optimal candidates that sounded really on the phone - the problem most likely "it's not you it's me". You screening process has to be adjusted. You should modify script and questions you ask. Analyze all failed candidates and see what was their shortcomings. Then add questions to the phone screen that will test those areas.
Always improve efficiency of the screening, otherwise you just gamble, hoping to roll a critical hit and get your next hire. Well, that's <a href="https://www.random.org/" alt="RNGesus">RNG</a> - not a hiring process.
