Why do we conduct screening interviews over the phone?
Because we are mean and want other people on the other end of the line to suffer?
Or we have nothing else to do but listen to the awkward, semi-stuttering speech with a phone static that makes this whole experience sound like a really bad DJ remix of some LoFi Jazz/HipHop stream on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lofi+hip+hop).

The time we invest into this conversation will pay off greatly when you won't be wasting yours and your coworker's time bringing in the "bad fit" candidate into the office.

If you bring a sub-optimal candidate into the office you will be wasting your and your coworker's time at a dramatic rate. Investing some of your time into the phone screen you will pay off greatly in the future. The important part is the efficiency of the screening.

You should always improve your hiring process. All the time.
Every interview, every call, every job post should be evaluated.

If you have a long streak of bad candidates that sounded really good over the phone - most likely it's not them but your screening process. You should adjust your screening process and modify script or questions you ask. Analyze all failed candidates and see what was their shortcomings. Then add questions to the phone screen that will test those areas.
