Why do we conduct interviews over the phone?
Because we mean and like to make people on the other end of the line to suffer?
Or we have nothing else to do but listen to the awkward, semi-stuttering speech with a phone static that makes this whole experience sound like a really bad DJ remix of some LoFi Jazz/HipHop stream on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lofi+hip+hop).
